There was blood on the table
And there were tears in the wine
With a sole invitation
To lay it on the line
She said somebody help me
Somebody help me break free
And there were eyes in the darkness
And they were looking at me

We started runnin' through the dead of the night
I said mama, mama, mama we'll make it alright

Running that anejo - layin' it on the line
Running that anejo - trying to make it clean
Running that anejo - man, we were running blind

It was five in the morning
There was no way out
All the shapes in the moonlight
And there was no doubt
I said "nobody move"
So we wouldn't be seen
Such a beautiful lady
And only 17

When it was time to run and test our fate
We were both under pressure
It was all we could take
Vigilantes given one more chance
It's the price you have to pay
If you want to take a stance

Running that anejo - layin' it on the line
Running that anejo - trying to make it clean
Running that anejo - man we were running blind
Running that anejo - caught in the battle zone
Running that anejo - lucky to be alive
Running that anejo - we knew we were on our own
Running that anejo - only hoped we'd survive

We started runnin' through the dead of the night
I said mama, mama, mama we'll make it alright

There was blood on the table
And there were tears in the wine
With cash in our pockets
We were running blind
Always the hunted
We ran hand in hand
All the way through the jungle
We cheated fate again

That was a night we'll never forget
Runnin' through the jungle you could taste the sweat
Into the open we were dead on our feet
I said mama, mama, mama let me tell 'bout the heat

Running that anejo - layin' it on the line
Running that anejo
Running that anejo - man we were running blind
Running that anejo
Running that anejo - caught in the battle zone
Running that anejo
Running that anejo - we knew we were on our own
Running that anejo
Running that anejo - lucky to be alive
Running that anejo
Running that anejo - only hoped we'd survive
